# Pzcheese

Simple POC of a front end that displays stocked items for a fictional Cheeseria. 
Product data is stored within the 'dataAPI' index file in a simple array and is filtered through an Angular interface via a Angular service and pushed to a simple html page. 

## To-Do Items
a>	Flesh out html and css
b>	Continue to build out reactive forms or similar as required for calculator function, right now calculator non-functional

## Challenges and Successes
a> API functional, serving data stored within an array to other units. 
b> Angular basics in place, using interfaces and services to filter data to the relevant components. 
c> Reading HTML is easy enough, creating it from scratch is a learning area for me, would seek support to upskill here. 
d> Angular module dependancies and imports is still a learning area, would turn to the team for troubleshooting and advice.

## Next Steps
a> Docker is new to me, I would have to have to research and learn about this suite to use in the field. 
b> Getting more hands-on experience and support with Angular (and Java/Typescript in general) is a high priority of mine.
