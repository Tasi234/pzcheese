# Pzcheese

Simple POC of a front end that displays stocked items for a fictional Cheeseria. 
Product data is stored within the 'dataAPI' index file in a simple array and is filtered through an Angular interface via a Angular service and pushed to a simple html page. 

## To-Do Items
a>	Flesh out html and css
b>	Continue to build out reactive forms or similar as required for calculator function, right now calculator non-functional.

## Challenges and Successes
a> Understanding angular modules and imports still a weak point for me
b> Building the API and component functionality easy enough once I got back into the swing of things
c> Reading HTML is easy enough, creating it from scratch is not a strong suit, and getting ChatGPT to generate it all doesn't prove my skillset. 
d> Have never used (or even heard of tbh) Docker before, will have to do some homework if this is a suite used irl. 
e> Spent far too much time troubleshooting HttpClientModule import errors.
